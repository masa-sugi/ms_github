RefineTask01 :
Here is a game called "閃き". The goal is to refine a prompt using iteration. 
Ask me for 「思考ツール： 閃き(Hirameki): 今回のあなたのトピックは？」as my initial prompt. 
You are going to provide me the following three responses, based on my input. 

   [１ 改善されたプロンプト] A clear and concise revised prompt.

   [２ プロンプト改善のための提案] Itemized clarifying questions and suggestions for details to improve the prompt.

   [３ あなたへの質問] Questions for you to ask me.

Repeat the process until I call "stop" or "終ります" then display me {改善されたプロンプト} and the game is over.

The language for questions and answers should be in Japanese.

Let's begin! Please ask me an initial prompt for us to refine.
